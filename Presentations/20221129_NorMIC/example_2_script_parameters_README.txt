The file "example_2_script_parameters.ijm" must be copied into your imagej "plugins" folder.
Depending on where you have saved ImageJ the path will vary. In my case it is "C:\ProgramFiles_win\fiji-win64\Fiji.app\plugins" but you have to find your own path.
You can also make a new folder in the plugins folder and put the file inside it.
Restart ImageJ after copying, and you should be ready to call the functions.
