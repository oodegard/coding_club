The file "example_5_importable_functions.py" must be copied into your imagej "jars\Lib" folder.
Depending on where you have saved ImageJ the path will vary. In my case it is "C:\ProgramFiles_win\fiji-win64\Fiji.app\jars\Lib" but you have to find your own path.
Restart ImageJ after copying, and you should be ready to call the functions.
